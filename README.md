# How-to-visualize-spectral-images

Hello!

In this project, I'm trying to visualize the spactral images using python.

As we know in a spectral image there is the fondamental function and a metameric black, so my project is to extract this signal(metameric black) and trying to give it a color or something so it will be visible because I beleive that this signal contain more information that we can use it in image processing.

You can find the image that I'm using for my example here.
